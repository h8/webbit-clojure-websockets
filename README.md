webbit-clojure-websockets
=========================

A simple chat web application written in Clojure.

This project is an adoption of the another example http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/02/clojure-web-socket-introduction.html
The main goal of this app is to demonstrate handling websockets along with standard http request/response cycle by a single web-server (Webbit) insatnce on the same port.

This code is not safe for using it in real applications.
